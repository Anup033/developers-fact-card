Your contribution is to make a card for yourself which will include your name, your fact, your profession and

You don't need to write any HTML or CSS, you just need to understand what the markup means so as to be able to make changes.

The project already provides you with a card template as seen below, indicating where you should copy and paste to and then modify the template for yourself. Remember, follow every instruction

3. By now you have the folder in your computer, so find the folder and open it in your preferred code editor, I will use VScode as a example here.

## Building your Fact card

Remember that this project is also meant to teach you and guide you how to read and heed to instructions. Make sure you read the instructions and heed to them.

1. You are only allowed to work on the `index.html` file and the `img` folder where you would be adding your image.

2. Look for the Template card with indications of green, telling you what to copy and where to paste it. It will look like this:

3. Copy the template that begins with `<section> `and ends with `</section>`, and paste it above after the last card, make sure you give one line for readability.

4. Now add a beautiful picture of you in the `img` folder, name the picture with your first name.

E.g if your first name is "precious" your image should be `precious.png` or `precious.jpg` as the case may be.

5. Now go ahead and add , your fact(your fact should be 2 lines only),your name, profession, and your social media links where indicated. DON'T MODIFY OR CHANGE ANY CLASS.

6. After that, you need to test if everything is okay, so view the project on your browser to see if your card is okay, by right clicking and clicking on `open with live server` or `open with browser`.

If there is an error, check if you modified or changed the markup or classes

## Pushing your project

If everything goes okay, beat your chest and say "Am a bad ass developer".

1. Open your terminal once again and run the following :

`git add img` and then commit your changes `git commit -m "Added my Image"`

You have commited your Image to Git!. NOw let commit your card.  Do that my running:

`git add index.html` and then commit your changes `git commit -m "Added "your name" card"`.

2. Now push your changes to your repository on your Github account.Now run:

`git push`.

Hooray!! You are getting there!

## Making a Pull request.

You must remember that this changes you made are visible on your own copy of the project you forked, so making a pull request will be asking me to add the changes to the original copy.

1. In your repository, click on the pull request tab, and then make a new pull request by clicking on the big green button with `new pull request` written on it and click on the next button with `create pull request`.

2. This is the last part of your pull request process, here you are going to add the title of your Pull request and an optional comment if you feel the need to. The title of your pull request should give informaton of your pull request. Follow the example below.
